The MixedUse building is located in Greece.

The HVAC system installed for the MixedUse building consists of two Air Handling Units (AHU), one dedicated exclusively to thermal zones 5, 6 and 7 and a second one serving to the remaining thermal zones. Both devices work in conjunction with variable refrigerant volume indoor units to air-condition interior spaces.
